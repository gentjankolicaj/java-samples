Dead lock happens when I have multiple threads trying to acquire intrinsic lock of some object but they cant
for some sort of reason,so they can't continue to call incoming method.
1.Dead locks are more likely to occur when i have multiple locks and I lock those locks in different order,
in this way different threads lock different locks but none of the locks can lock all the lock needed to call the shared resource.


How to avoid deadlocks:
1.lock lockers in same order all over the program
2.write e method that helps
