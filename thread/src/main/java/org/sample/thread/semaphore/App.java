/**
 * Example with semaphore:
 * <br>Semaphore is used to control access to a shared resource with help of a counter variable :
 * <br>1.Signaling mechanism
 * <br>2.Process/Thread blocks itself till resource is released
 * <br>3.Maintains a set of permits
 * <br>
 * -acquire(): if a permit is available then takes it -release(): adds a permit Note: if we set
 * fairness to true=> every single thread is going to access resources
